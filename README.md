# Power-bi-project-Analyzing-Customer-Churn
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Databel


Project Overview
----------------

This Case Study of Power BI is about analyzing the customer churn of a subscription-based telecom company, Databel. Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses, so understanding churn effectively becomes the main tool for customer retention and profit incrementation.

This project is a detailed customer survey of Databel in which we will reveal the identification and visualization of key metrics of customer churn that give the information about patterns and factors that make the churn. The researchers take a step further than only calculating the churn rate and give reasons, and possible consequences of the customer leaving the firm, ending with recommendations of how to mitigate churn.
